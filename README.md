## Welcome

This repo documents my work to train an agent to solve a Rubik's Cube using a variant of deep reinforcement learning inspired by Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf).

## Quick Start

To train a neural network to approximate the Q-function run:

```
python train.py --config_path configs/<config_file>.yaml 
```
